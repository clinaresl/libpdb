# Introduction

`libpdb` provides means for creating Pattern Databases in different permutation
state spaces. In particular, it assumes that either full or partial states are
represented with a vector of integers which are all different. Eligible domains
are the N-Pancake, the sliding-tile puzzle or the TopSpin.

It supports both *MAX* and *ADD* pattern databases.

# Dependencies

Tests have been created using the [Google Test
Framework](https://github.com/google/googletest) which is necessary for both
compiling and runing the tests, see below.designed using

# Install #

To download the code type the following:

``` sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/clinaresl/libpdb.git
```

To compile the source code, create first the `Makefile` with:

``` sh
    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    $ make
```

from the `libpdb/` directory created after the clone. It will build the library,
and a generator for every domain defined under `domains/`, and all the unit
tests.

It is also possible to compile separately different parts of the whole bundle.
To compile only the library do:

``` sh
   $ make libpdb
```

which generates a static library.

To generate an executable to solve instances in a specific domain use `make
domain` where *domain* can be any of the following: `npancake` or `npuzzle`.

# Tests #

This library comes with a number of unit tests that have been implemented with
[Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). If Google Test is available
in your computer, then you can compile and run the tests with:

``` sh
    $ make gtest
    $ tests/gtest
```

from the `libpdb/` directory created after the clone.
