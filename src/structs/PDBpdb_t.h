        //       symbols in the goal state (which is the one used, after being
        //       masked, to generate the PDB). The goal has to be explicitly
        //       given, i.e., it can never be abstracted
        //
        //    2. Pattern (_pattern): consists of a string of symbols '-' and
        //       '*', so that the i-th symbol in _goal is preserved in the
        //       abstract state space if and only if pattern[i]='-' and
