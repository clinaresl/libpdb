        //       symbols in the goal state (which is the one used, after being
        //       masked, to generate the PDB)
        //
        //    2. Pattern (_pattern): consists of a string of symbols '-' and
        //       '*', so that the i-th symbol in _goal is preserved in the
        //       abstract state space if and only if pattern[i]='-' and

        //       automatically from the information given next
